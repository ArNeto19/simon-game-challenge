# The Simon Game Challenge

v1.0.0
This is a sample of a Simon Game initially made with some HTML, CSS and Javascript. This project was proposed to keep on practice the recently earned knowledge on Javascript and jQuery.

v1.1.0
Improved game.js code to properly simulate original simon game structure of display.

v1.2.0
By integrating the initial project with a Backend to retrieve data from MongoDB (as API request logic), added the Leaderboard feature, so players can compete to see who gets the highest score.

I would like to thanks @angelabauer for the marvelous course.
